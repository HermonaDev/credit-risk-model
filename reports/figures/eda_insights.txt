EDA INSIGHTS SUMMARY
==================================================
1. **High-Quality Transaction Data**: 95,662 transactions across 3,742 unique customers with ZERO missing values. All data in UGX currency (CountryCode 256).

2. **Low Fraud Rate but High-Value Correlation**: Only 0.20% (193 transactions) are fraudulent, but fraud strongly correlates with transaction amount (r=0.56). High-value transactions warrant scrutiny.

3. **Extreme Transaction Skew**: Amount distribution extremely skewed (skew: 51.10). Mean transaction: UGX 6,718, Median: UGX 1,000. High percentage of outliers indicates heavy-tailed distribution.

4. **Provider & Channel Concentration**: Top 2 providers (ProviderId_4: 39.9%, ProviderId_6: 35.7%) handle 75.6% of transactions. ChannelId_3 dominates (59.5% of transactions). Financial services (47.5%) and airtime (47.1%) are primary product categories.

5. **Amount-Value Near-Perfect Correlation**: Amount and Value correlation = 0.99 (expected as Value = |Amount|). Consider dropping one to avoid multicollinearity.
